# TF-Motif-Occurrences
This repository will have a few python notebooks which can find occurrences and co-occurrences of Transcription Factor motifs in genomic data (FASTA files).

Motif_Co-occurrence_Calculation: To find co-occurrences of motifs (either inputted by hand or chosen from the MEME tool results which will be displayed) in a fasta file. This notebook will then print out extensive statistical results about the co-occurrences (histograms with the frequencies of the length between the two motifs) and display the sequence logos of the most common sequences before and after the motif
